# Mysterious-Organisms
The idea of this project is to simulate organisms with different DNA sequences. 
Once the organisms and their DNA sequences are randomly created we check if they've mutated, we find the percentage of DNA they have in common and finally we select the ones that are most likely to survive based on their DNA.   
This project was made with Javascript.
